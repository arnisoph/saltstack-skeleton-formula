Instructions
------------

Please refer to https://github.com/bechtoldt/formula-docs to learn how to use
this formula, how it is built and how you can add your changes.

**NOTICE:** This formula uses the formhelper module which is a very useful Salt execution module that isn't available
in upstream yet. Please consider retrieving it manually from `salt-modules <https://github.com/bechtoldt/salt-modules>`_ and
make it available to your Salt installation. Read `SaltStack documentation <http://docs.saltstack.com/en/latest/ref/modules/#modules-are-easy-to-write>` to
see how this can be achieved.

Take a look at older `releases <https://github.com/bechtoldt/saltstack-skeleton-formula/releases>` to get a version that isn't using the formhelper
yet (if any).


Compatibility
-------------

See <TODO> file to see which Salt versions and operating systems are supported.


Dependencies
------------

None


Contributing
------------

Contributions are welcome! All development guidelines we ask you to follow can
be found at https://github.com/bechtoldt/formula-docs.

In general:

1. Fork this repo on Github
2. Add changes, test them, update docs (README.rst) if possible
3. Submit your pull request (PR) on Github, wait for feedback

But it’s better to `file an issue <https://github.com/bechtoldt/saltstack-skeleton-formula/issues/new>`_ with your idea first.


TODO
----

* add instructions how to use formhelper, add information about it in the
  formula-docs (dependency), show up alternative?
* table/ matrix: os/salt compatibility (dedicated file)
* add list of available states
* add tests
